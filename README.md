# ETL Assignment: Stored Procedure

## Objective:
Design a stored procedure to transfer data from a transactional database to a staging area, then load it into a data warehouse (fact and dimension tables), and datamart.

## Requirements:
- Basic understanding of SQL
- Access to a database management system (DBMS) such as PostgreSQL, etc.

## Task:
Design a stored procedure named `dwh.generate_ecommerce_transaction()` to perform the following tasks:
1. Transfer data from the transactional database tables to corresponding staging tables.
2. Load data from staging tables into appropriate dimension tables in the data warehouse.
3. Load data from staging tables into appropriate fact tables in the data warehouse.
5. Provide clear documentation within the stored procedure.

## Submission Guidelines:
1. **Stored Procedure Script:** Include the SQL script containing the stored procedure `dwh.generate_ecommerce_transaction()`. This script should encompass all necessary steps for transferring data from the transactional database to the staging area, loading it into the data warehouse's dimension and fact tables, and finally, into the datamart.

2. **Slide Presentation:** Create a slide presentation to accompany the stored procedure. Each slide should focus on explaining a specific step of the procedure, detailing its significance, execution process, and impact on the overall ETL workflow. Ensure the slides are clear, concise, and visually appealing to facilitate understanding.

3. **Zip Archive Submission:** Save both the stored procedure script and the slide presentation as separate files within a zip archive. This zip file should be submitted through the Learning Management System (LMS) to facilitate grading and feedback.

By adhering to these submission guidelines, you will provide a comprehensive overview of the stored procedure and its implementation, enhancing clarity and understanding for evaluation purposes.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- Correctness and completeness of the stored procedure.
- Documentation quality and clarity.
- Adherence to best practices in SQL development.
